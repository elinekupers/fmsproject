This directory contains MATLAB code needed to run Population Receptive Field fitting associated with the paper, 

Winawer, Kay, Foster, Parvizi, Wandell. Asynchronous broadband signals are the principal source of the BOLD response in human visual cortex. Current Biology, 2013

The main function used for the paper above is 'fitprf.m'. Other functions in this repository are used by fitprf or, in a few cases, are used for organizing data structures and/or reading/writing files.

The developer of the code in this directory is Kendrick Kay (kendrick@post.harvard.edu, http://kendrickkay.net). The code is related to other recent publications (Kay, Winawer, Mezer, Wandell. Compressive spatial summation in human visual cortex. Journal of Neurophysiology, 2013, doi:10.1152/jn.00105.2013; Kay, Winawer, Rokem, Mezer, Wandell. A Two-Stage Cascade Model of BOLD Responses in Human Visual Cortex. PLoS Computational Biology, 2013, doi:10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003079), and there is a separate web site associated with these publications: http://kendrickkay.net/socmodel/. The code in this directory is shared across the various publications, and a rewritten version of the code (that removes legacy content and improves clarity and simplicity) will be made available at this web site.
